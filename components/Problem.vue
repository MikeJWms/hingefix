              We love our M50 headphones, but they have one major design flaw -
              the hinges. Over time, a part in the hinge breaks and prohibits
              the ear cup from hugging your ear.
            </p>
            <p>
              This effects all versions of the M50: original ATH-M50 headphones
              with the attached cable, ATH-M50x with the interchangeable cable,
              and the new ATH-M50xBT Bluetooth headphones.
            </p>
            <p>That's why we made HingeFix.</p>
